Movie Recommender System adds a whole new dimension to the movie watching experience by
providing real-time personalized movie recommendations to users. It takes a collaborative socialnetworking approach where a user’s own tastes are mixed with that of the entire community to generate meaningful results. Most existing movie services like IMDB (www.imdb.com) do not
personalize their recommendations but simply provide an overall rating for a movie. This
significantly decreases the value of each recommendation as it does not cater to the individual
movie preferences of the user. Unlike these systems, movie recommender system’s
Recommendation Engine will continually analyze individual user’s movie preferences and
recommend custom movie recommendations. The overall goal is to ease the movie discovery
process. movie recommender system is purely a movie recommendation service in that it offers a
list of movie suggestions based on previous user ratings. movie recommender system is designed
not to search for movies but to discover them through our recommendation process. movie
recommender system will allow users to rate movies they have seen. This data is then analyzed,
and recommendations are then returned to the user. The core of this notebook is movie recommender
system’s recommendation algorithm, is based on a cluster-smoothed collaborative filtering
algorithm. We have refined and tuned the parameters around this algorithm by comparing our
predicted ratings against actual ratings using in-sample and out-of-sample techniques as well as
analyzing live user feedback.
